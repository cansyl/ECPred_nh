## Dependencies

#### Java 8  

For Linux, you can install latest version of Java by running following commands from terminal:

```
brew update
brew cask install java
```

#### g++ (any version)  

For Linux, you can install latest version of g++ by running following commands from terminal
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
For Mac, you can install g++ by running following command from terminal. <br />

 ```
 g++
 ```
 If you've already installed g++, the terminal prints this message, "no input files". <br />

## Download
```
ECPred.tar.gz
```
Above file (around 3 GB) should be downloaded from:

http://cansyl.metu.edu.tr/ECPred.html

## Installation

Extract the files using: <br />
```
tar -xvf ECPred.tar.gz  
```
After extraction the total size of the folder will be around 10 GB. <br />

Run runLinux.sh or runMac.sh from terminal according to your OS using one of these commands: <br />
```
./runLinux.sh 
```
or <br />
```
./runMac.sh
```
These bash scripts will install necessary libraries and tools.

## Usage

Run the following command on terminal to analyze the file "filename.fasta"  <br />
```
java -jar ECPred.jar method inputFile libraryDir tempDir outputFile
```
method argument can be one of the followings: blast, spmap, pepstats, weighted.<br />
inputFile argument is the file that contains that you want to predict.<br />
libraryDir argument is the directory where the "lib" folder is located.<br />
tempDir argument is the directory where the chunk files are located. You may delete the files under this directory after a couple of runs.<br />
outputFile argument is optional. If you don't specify the output file name the results will be printed to standard output.


## Input

There is no limit on the number of protein sequences, however, one protein is predicted in 9 minutes on average on the i7-6820HQ processor.

## Output


## Data files

"ECNumberList.txt":  <br />

A text file containing the list of EC numbers that ECPred can predict.  <br />

"sample.fasta":  <br />

An example input fasta file.  <br />

"predictionResults.tsv":  <br />

An example output prediction file (for sample.fasta).
