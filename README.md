## ECPred_woH Version 1.0
 
 [![Latest Github release](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/cansyl/ECPred_nh/releases/latest)
 
ECPred_withoutHierarchy (ECPred_woH) is the ECPred version which does not consider the hierarchical relations of the EC numbers. Hence all of the EC number predictions which satisfy the cut-off values are given as output. 

## Dependencies

#### Java 8  

For Linux, you can install latest version of Java by running following commands from terminal:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jre
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```
For Mac, you can install latest version of Java by running following commands from terminal:
```
brew update
brew cask install java
```

#### g++ (any version)  

For Linux, you can install latest version of g++ by running following commands from terminal
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
For Mac, you can install g++ by running following command from terminal. <br />

 ```
 g++
 ```
 If you've already installed g++, the terminal prints this message, "no input files". <br />

## Download
```
ECPred.tar.gz
```
Above file (around 3 GB) should be downloaded from:

http://cansyl.metu.edu.tr/ECPred.html

## Installation

Extract the files using: <br />
```
tar -xvf ECPred.tar.gz  
```
After extraction the total size of the folder will be around 10 GB. <br />

Run runLinux.sh or runMac.sh from terminal according to your OS using one of these commands: <br />
```
./runLinux.sh 
```
or <br />
```
./runMac.sh
```
These bash scripts will install necessary libraries and tools.

## Usage

```
java -jar ECPred_woH.jar method inputFile libraryDir tempDir outputFile
```
```method ``` argument can be one of the following: blast, spmap, pepstats, weighted<br />
```inputFile```  argument is the file that contains protein sequences in fasta format<br />
```libraryDir``` is the path to the directory where the "lib" folder is located <br />
```tempDir``` is the path to the directory where the temporary files are located. You may wish to delete these files after you complete your prediction runs. <br />
```outputFile``` argument is optional. If you don't specify the output file name, the results will be printed to standard output. <br/>

Sample run <br />
```
java -jar ECPred_woH.jar weighted test.fasta /Desktop/ECPred/ temp/ results.tsv
```


## Input

There is no limit on the number of protein sequences; however, a single protein is predicted in nine minutes on average on an Intel 2.70 GHz i7 processor.

## Output

Output is optinal. If you don't specify the output file name, the results will be printed to standard output.

## Data files

"ECNumberList.txt":  <br />

A text file containing the list of EC numbers that ECPred can predict.  <br />

"sample.fasta":  <br />

An example input fasta file.  <br />

"results.tsv":  <br />

An example output prediction file (for sample.fasta).
